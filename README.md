## Overview

This project analyzes a 5.8 million-row 2015 U.S. flight dataset to optimize IndiGo's On-Time Arrival Rate (OTAR). The objective is to identify delay drivers and propose strategies to enhance flight reliability and operational efficiency.

## Objectives
- Identify key factors contributing to flight delays.
- Provide recommendations to improve schedule and hub efficiency.
- Enhance OTAR through data-driven insights.

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) in Jupyter Notebook to clean data, capping outliers (e.g., ARRIVAL_DELAY, WEATHER_DELAY).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to identify delay patterns (e.g., JFK taxi-out times, weather routes).
-Visualization: Created dashboards with Tableau to highlight trends.
-Recommendations: Proposed schedule and hub efficiency improvements.

## Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages & Frameworks: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau

Techniques: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA, Univariate/Bivariate/Multivariate), Data Visualization
